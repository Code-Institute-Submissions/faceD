#### Functionality / Technologies 

The page uses Bootstrap to makes use of it's grid system and other styling.

The page uses the 'Fredericka the Great','Open Sans'and 'Roboto' fonts from Google Fonts.

My own further styling has been done within ext_css/main.css. 

The page also uses Intro.js for giving a quick tour to new users.

I used Lucidchart for create my wireframe https://www.lucidchart.com/ 

I used DC D3 crossfilter  queue for creating my charts.

There are 18 functions that I used in this website 

######

#### Design
The layout of the page has been kept very basic to keep the methods obvious and simple.
    
#### Testing 
 The JavaScript code was run on JSHint and returned no errors but It have 4 undefined variables it because my own JS code has  seperate file I guess,This not going to affect my website. 
The HTML was run on the W3C Markup Validator and returned no errors.

 ##### Responsiveness
Using Google Chrome developer tools to test how each stage of the application displays at different screen width.

##### Dashboards are intended for full size screens 
Why am I saying this in mobile-screen, charts are affecting my footer.
